CSVs are too large to upload onto Github or Gradescope, but they can be found here and downloaded off here.

Download XAMPP
https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

Or, connect to JHU server at dbase.cs.jhu.edu

Start XAMPP server
sudo /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/bin/mysql.server start

Your unzipped project folder should look like this
spotify/
│── index.php
│── db.php
│── schema.sql
│── processing.sql
│── queries/
│     ├── artist_tracks.php
│     ├── top_artists.php
│     ├── albums_audio.php
│     ├── trends.php
│     ├── discovery.php
│     └── similarity.php
│── csv/
      ├── tracks_features.csv
      └── spotify_artist_data.csv

Move this folder into /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/ on Mac or C:\xampp\htdocs\ on Windows

In MySqlWorkbench:
CREATE DATABASE spotify_db;

Run schema.sql and processing.sql to create and populate the database

If processing.sql gets interrupted, you can increase global max allowed packet size in MySql with a command like this:
max_allowed_packet = 256M 
You can run this up until the “querying” comment at line 325.
Make sure Apache is up and running in order to access the interface on localhost. 

Start XAMPP server and Apache
Site should be live at http://localhost/spotify/
